        <h1>FAJRLY SUPPORT</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Fajrly support! We're here to help you wake up for Fajr prayer consistently.</p>
        
        <h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
        
        <h3>1. How does Fajrly calculate Fajr times?</h3>
        <p>Fajrly uses your device location and the Aladhan API to calculate accurate Fajr prayer times based on your geographic coordinates. The app automatically updates your alarm time daily.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Will the alarm work when my phone is locked?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Fajrly uses iOS background audio capabilities to ensure the alarm sounds even when the app is closed or your phone is locked.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Can I snooze the alarm?</h3>
        <p>No. Fajrly intentionally does not include a snooze feature. You must solve the math problem correctly to dismiss the alarm. This ensures you're fully awake for Fajr prayer.</p>
        
        <h3>4. How do I change the difficulty level?</h3>
        <p>Go to Settings in the app and select Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty for the math problems.</p>
        
        <h3>5. What happens if I miss a day?</h3>
        <p>Your current streak will reset to zero, but your longest streak record and total wake-ups are preserved. You can start building a new streak the next day.</p>
        
        <h3>6. Why does Fajrly need location permission?</h3>
        <p>Location permission is required to calculate accurate Fajr prayer times for your area. Without location access, the app cannot determine the correct prayer time.</p>
        
        <h3>7. Does Fajrly work when traveling?</h3>
        <p>Yes! The app automatically detects your new location and adjusts the Fajr time accordingly.</p>
        
        <h3>8. How do I delete my account?</h3>
        <p>Email <a href="mailto:appfajrly@gmail.com">appfajrly@gmail.com</a> with "Account Deletion Request" in the subject line. Include your registered email address, and we'll delete your account within 30 days.</p>
